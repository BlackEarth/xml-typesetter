# xml-typesetter
InDesign scripts used for XML-based publishing.

This repository contains InDesign scripts that can be used for XML publishing with InDesign.

To install the scripts, either link or copy the UserScripts folder into the InDesign user scripts directory.

1. **Find the InDesign user scripts directory:** In InDesign open the Scripts palette. Right-click on the "User" folder and select "Reveal in Finder/Explorer." This is the InDesign user scripts folder — it might be called "Scripts Panel" in the filesystem.

2. **Link or Copy the xml-typesetter/UserScripts folder into the InDesign user scripts folder:**
    + **macOS:** Right-click on the bg-typesetter/UserScripts folder and select "Make Alias". Rename the alias to "bg-typesetter". Drag the alias and drop it insider the InDesign user scripts / "Scripts Panel" folder.
    + **Windows:** Click on the bg-typesetter/UserScripts folder to select it. Hold down the Alt key, then drag the folder and drop it (copy it, you should see a "+" by your mouse) into the InDesign user scripts / "Scripts Panel" folder. Too bad for Windows that its shortcuts don’t work here.
